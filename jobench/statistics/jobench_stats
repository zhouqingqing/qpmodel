Nala, Archie and little Sadie, a Boston Terrier are basically this couple\u0027s kids, and each one has a distinct personality. But the clear ruler of the household is Sadie who has a multitude of dog beds, a wealth of toys and a wardrobe that would be the envy of any human child.

We couldn\u0027t pick up anything but police calls.","Paris, 1942. Robert Klein cannot find any fault with the state of affairs in German-occupied France. He has a well-furnished flat, a mistress, and business is booming. Jews facing discrimination because of laws edicted by the French government are desperate to sell valuable works of art - and it is easy for him to get them at bargain prices. His cosy life is disrupted when he realizes that there is another Robert Klein in Paris - a Jew with a rather mysterious behaviour. Very soon, this homonymy attracts the close - and menacing - attention of the police on the established art trader.","PFM:16 mm","Poland:1 March 2007","Portugal:4 May 1942","RAT:1.66 : 1","Rochefort: Milady, it is a great pleasure to see you again.

The train comes straight at the audience, and it seems as if it would run right into the front row of seats, until it strikes a curve, changes it direction, and passes on at a high rate of speed, giving a side view of the engine and cars. A very fine picture of the finest train between Chicago and California.","The film begins by stating its intentions: \u0027Douglas Fairbanks (I)\u0027 (qv) mixes ingredients labeled Mystery, Adventure, Romance, Comedy, Pep, and Ginger to create a cake iced with the film\u0027s title.","The series finale was preempted, halfway through, on the west coast, as ABC News was breaking the story of Princess Diana\u0027s fatal car accident in Paris.

Thai was born in Nashville, Tennessee, to Nga Huynh. Thai is the middle of three brothers. He was raised by his mother after his father left the family.  Three years passed and Thai and his family moved to San Jose, California where his mother found a job at a restaurant. He lived an innocent childhood while his parents struggled to put food on the table and care for him and his brothers. At the age of seven, he was left with memories that emotionally scarred him. His father kissed him and said goodbye while his family was eating dinner.  In 1993, Thai\u0027s mother moved her family to Portland, Oregon to start a better life. Life did not get better, it only got worse. Without a father to help care for the family, his mother worked two to three minimum wage jobs to care for her family. At a young age, Thai would roam the streets trying to find a place to be accepted, spending most of his time around Asian gangs.  After finishing the 6th grade, Thai\u0027s mother was offered a restaurant job in a small city located just outside of Portland. She accepted the offer and once again moved her family. Thai was enrolled at a new school, starting the 7th grade. He didn\u0027t have many friends nor much to do, so he began getting more into music. He used lyrics from other rap artists such as Bone Thugs \u0026 Harmony, 2Pac, Eazy-E and used other artist\u0027s instrumentals and rapped the lyrics over them. He began developing his own unique style when he began writing.  At the age of twelve, Thai and his family moved back to Portland, Oregon. He continued to hang out with the same crowd, continuing his old life where he left off. A little after he turned thirteen, he was caught with a much older gang in the involvement of a gang shooting after school in broad daylight. He was arrested and put in jail, facing nine years if convicted. At the time, he was scared and didn\u0027t know what would happen, thinking he would be sent off to jail. Since he was young and the shooting was his first offense, he was let off with probation. He felt blessed and thought about changing his ways when he was released. Instead, he went back to his lifestyle with the streets.  Thai and his gang was involved in countless shootings, their homes being shot up numerous times, getting into fights weekly at all rival gang hangouts, and was always a high profile suspect with the gang task force unit. At such a young age, he dealt with street drama, thinking he would either die or go to jail. Even after seeing many of his friends sent to jail, he never thought about changing his ways.  After many years, Thai is still in the same place of his life. Knowing one day something bad would happen, Thai was at a party when a drive-by hit, letting off over forty rounds into the home. While he was trying to fire back, he was hit, but luckily just once, only shattering his bone. He went to the hospital where soon after he was released with a cast to his left arm. At times he felt as he was stuck, and even being shot at, he felt as he never changed. However, he did become more careful with his life, but he seemed to be the same person. It\u0027s part of his life story. Throughout his years growing up he wrote about his life experiences of the things he\u0027s been through and seen.  While hanging out at a pool hall with a few friends, he was a target of much older rivals that had much hatred towards him. He was attacked and stabbed in the face with pool sticks, leaving him hospitalized.  Thai started out his career online, and around his neighborhood. He recorded the 7 track EP called \u0022Portland Love\u0022 which included the hit singles \u0022Vietnamese Gang\u0022 and \u0022Around My Town\u0022. After this partner, Khanh Nho (also featured on Vietnamese gang), suggested that they seek an official rap career. Thai traveled to a studio on the Northside of Portland, where he met producer, C.Ant. \u0022Together We Rize\u0022, was the first album to be distributed \u0022in CD format\u0022 across the United States, however, as of 2008, Thai is currently not signed to a major label. He has 1 EP and 2 full albums released independently to date, with his latest being My Life \u0026 Rhymes. All songs on the album were produced by \u0027DJ Slim\u0027 (qv) except for one track (Heart \u0026 Soul), and features other well known rap artists, Jimmyboi, Snacky Chan and Cool Nutz, the album also contains a DVD with 3 music videos (\u0022Rock Your Body,\u0022 \u0022My Life and Rhymes\u0022 and \u0022Roll Wit Uz\u0022).  Thai was heavily inspired by famous early R\u0026B musicians such as Michael Jackson, Boyz ll Men, and Stevie B, as well as early rap musicians like 2Pac, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Eazy-E, Twista, and Deathrow. While recording \u0022Portland Love\u0022 and \u0022Together We Rize\u0022, Thai\u0027s style was fast-paced, similar to Bone Thugs-N-Harmony and Twista, but now he raps with more a slower laid back flow and is known for his deep lyrics. Many have compared him to the hip hop legend 2pac, calling him an Asian version of 2pac.","Theater: (2000) played the Black Prince in George Bernard Shaw\u0027s \u0022The Six of Calais\u0022 at the (Musee Rodin, Paris, France.)","Triebel, Dirk Simplizius","TV commercial: MyLife.com","Victor Julio was born one day before another Tig in the same Hospital and they shared the maternity ward together for the first days of their lives.
