/*
SELECT is implemented as if a query was executed in the following order:
1. CTEs: every one is evaluated and evaluated once as if it is served as temp table.
2. FROM clause: every one in from clause evaluated. They together evaluated as a Cartesian join.
3. WHERE clause: filters, including joins filters are evaluated.
4. GROUP BY clause: grouping according to group by clause and filtered by HAVING clause.
5. SELECT [ALL|DISTINCT] clause: ALL (default) will output every row and DISTINCT removes
duplicates.
6. Set Ops: UION [ALL] | INTERSECT| EXCEPT combines multiple output of SELECT.
7. ORDER BY clause: sort the results with the specified order.
8. LIMIT|FETCH|OFFSET clause: restrict amount of results output.
