This docuement describes the process required to use andb parser in the new
native code while running on Windows.

GNU flex and bison are not available on Windows. Someone ported them to
windows, this project is called winflex/winbison and is avaliable on
sourceforge. It was descided that since Windows is only transitional, not
to use winfles/winbison but to use a Linux system to compile these files.


To maintain naming consistency, the following changes are made to original
andb.l and andb.y.

   1) Rename bison_parser.h as andb_parser.h.
   2) Rename andb.tab.c as andb_parser.cpp
   3) Rename flex_lexer.h as andb_lexer.h
   4) Rename flex_lexer.cpp ad andb_lexer.cpp

The generated files #include <unistd.h>. winfles/winbison also do the same.
WHile this is not a problem on Unix platforms, this will not compile on
Windows, therefore the include is placed under #ifdef _MSC_VER.

All these changes are done automatically by a shell script checked in to
server/make-tools/port-andb.sh.

If any changes to .l or .y file are to made, make them in andb.l or andb.y as
required, copy them and the script to a Linux machine with flex and bison and
run the script.
copy the output files back into parser/syntax before building the project.

The output files of the script are:
andb_lexer.cpp
andb_lexer.h
andb_parser.cpp
andb_parser.h
andb_parser.output
andb_parser.y
